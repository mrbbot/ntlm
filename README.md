# NTLM

A library for NTLM authentication in Dart/Flutter.

## Installing

Add the dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ntlm: ^2.0.2
```

## Example

```dart
import 'package:ntlm/ntlm.dart';

main() {
  NTLMClient client = new NTLMClient(
    domain: "",
    workstation: "LAPTOP",
    username: "User208",
    password: "password",
  );

  client.get(Uri.parse("https://example.com/")).then((res) {
    print(res.body);
  });
}
```

You can also pre-hash the password and use those results instead:

```dart
String lmPassword = lmHash("password");
String ntPassword = ntHash("password");

NTLMClient client = new NTLMClient(
  domain: "",
  workstation: "LAPTOP",
  username: "User208",
  lmPassword: lmPassword,
  ntPassword: ntPassword,
);
```

If your server only supports the
[`Negotiate` authentication scheme](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/understanding-http-authentication#http-authentication-schemes),
you can change the header prefix to `Negotiate` using the `headerPrefix` parameter:

```dart
NTLMClient client = new NTLMClient(
  domain: "",
  workstation: "LAPTOP",
  username: "User208",
  password: "password",
  headerPrefix: kHeaderPrefixNegotiate,
);
```

Note that this still only uses the NTLM authentication scheme, not Kerberos.

## Flutter Web Support

For cross-origin requests, make sure your server includes the following headers in responses:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: <your_origin>
Access-Control-Expose-Headers: WWW-Authenticate
Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Authorization
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

This allows the package to both view NTLM messages sent by the server and send requests with NTLM messages.
